# filtered-word-lists
NSFW This repository contains many racial slurs, sexual terms, and more. These lists are designed to be used to help censor and filter X-rated words from your application.

wordfilter_onlyifstandalone is designed for if a user sends a message containing that word with no other non-break characters sent with it.
wordfilter_blanketbanned is designed so that even if the word is surrounded in other text it will still be caught and removed.

The lists are split up this way to reduce false postitives such as "grape", "night", and many more. While it is not a perfect solution this is a starting place. Please feel free to use and contribute as you please.
